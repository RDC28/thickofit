🗺️ HOW TO ADD GOOGLE MAPS TO QGIS USING THAT URL
✅ Step 1: Open QGIS
Make sure you're using QGIS 3.x version (newer is better)

✅ Step 2: Go to Browser Panel (or Layer → Data Source Manager)
In QGIS, look at the left side panel
If you don’t see “Browser,” go to View → Panels → Browser Panel

Scroll down to XYZ Tiles

Right-click XYZ Tiles → New Connection

✅ Step 3: Add New Tile Layer
Fill out the dialog:

Name: Google Maps (or whatever you like)

URL:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=r&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}
Leave other settings as default

Click OK

✅ Step 4: Use It as a Basemap
Now under XYZ Tiles, you’ll see Google Maps

Double-click to load it onto your map canvas

It will behave like a normal basemap — zoom, pan, etc.
