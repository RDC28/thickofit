üîç Part 2: Perform Spatial Queries and Analysis

### **1. Add a new column `Garden_area` and calculate the area of each garden**

#### ‚úÖ Steps:
- Open **Garden** layer‚Äôs attribute table (right click on garden layer in the layer menu on the left side of the screen)
- Click on **Field Calculator** (abacus icon)
- Create a **new field**:  
  - Name: `Garden_area`  
  - Type: Decimal or Float  
  - type the following thing in the Expression box at the bottom: `area($geometry)` 
  - Click **OK** to apply

---

### **2. Show the largest garden**

#### ‚úÖ Steps:
- In the **Garden** layer‚Äôs attribute table (right click on garden layer in the layer menu on the left side of the screen):
  - tap on the 'Area' column header to sort it ascending or descending

---

### **3. Show all the railway tracks that intersect with Highways**

#### ‚úÖ Steps:
- Use **Vector tab on top	 ‚Üí Geoprocessing Tools ‚Üí Intersect**
  - Input Layer: **Railway Tracks**
  - Overlay Layer: **Highways**
  - Output: Save as new layer: `Rail_Highway_Intersect`
- Open resulting layer to see which railway tracks intersect

Or use **Select by Location**:
- Layer to select from: **Railway Tracks**
- Spatial operation: **intersect**
- With: **Highways**
- This will highlight the intersecting tracks

---

### **4. Find all the restaurants inside a garden**

#### ‚úÖ Steps:
- Use **Select by Location**:
  - Select features from: **Restaurants**
  - Where the feature: **is within**
  - Source layer: **Garden**
- Export selected features to a new layer if needed

---

### **5. Find all railway tracks that do *not* intersect with highway**

#### ‚úÖ Steps:
Use **Select by Location**, then **invert selection**:

1. Select railway tracks that **intersect** highways (as in step 3)
2. Go to **Edit ‚Üí Invert Selection**
3. You'll now have the railway tracks that **do not** intersect highways

Or use **Expression** (if `Intersected` field was created):
```sql
"Intersected" IS NULL
```

Let me know if you‚Äôd like the **layer creation steps** or help doing this in **Python (using GeoPandas)** or want screenshots for QGIS.
