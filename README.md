# I got people talking down, man, it’s such a shame
# But when I’m winning, they gon’ say that they knew me from day
# Ain’t nobody really know what I been through, okay?
# Now I’m finally at the top and feeling so great"

# "I’m in the thick of it, can’t you see?
# Never back down, that’s the life for me
# Ain’t no way that they can take my peace
# Came a long way just to live this dream
