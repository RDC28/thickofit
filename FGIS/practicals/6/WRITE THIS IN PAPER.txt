### **QGIS Practical – Railway Route Map (CST to Chembur)**

#### **Part 1: Create Layers**

1. **Open QGIS** and create a new project (e.g., "RailwayRouteMap").

2. **Create Vector Layers** using **Layer → Create Layer → New Shapefile Layer**:

   - **Line Layers**:  
     - Railway Route (CST to Chembur)  
     - Adjacent Roads to Railway  
     - Railway Tracks  

   - **Polygon Layers**:  
     - Buildings Adjacent to Railway  
     - Railway Stations (CST, Chembur, etc.)  

   - **Point Layers**:  
     - Railway Stations (CST, Chembur, and others in between)  
     - Bus Stops near stations  

3. **Add Features** using **Toggle Editing → Add Feature Tool** for each of the above layers.

#### **Part 2: Style and Customize Map**

4. **Styling the Layers**  
   - Use **Layer Properties > Symbology** to:
     - Style the railway track with a line symbol  
     - Buildings adjacent to the railway can be styled with polygons  
     - Stations can be marked with point symbols (e.g., a station icon)

5. **Add Labels to Stations**  
   - Use **Layer Properties > Labels** to show names of stations along the route.

   - Go to **Project → New Print Layout** and give it a name (e.g., "Railway Route Layout").

7. **Add Map to Layout**  
   - Click **Add Map** and drag to define the map area.

8. **Add Map Elements**  
   - Add **North Arrow**  
   - Add **Legend**  
   - Add **Scale Bar**  
   - Add **Title** (e.g., "Railway Route: CST to Chembur")

9. **Export the Map**  
   - Go to **Layout → Export as Image**  
   - Choose **JPEG/PDF** format and save your map.
