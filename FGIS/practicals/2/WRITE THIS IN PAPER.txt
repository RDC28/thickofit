### QGIS Practical: **Residential Area Map Creation with Features**

#### 1. **Create a Map of Your Residential Area**:
   - **Set up a new project** in QGIS and define the **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** as **WGS 84** or any suitable projection.
   - **Create Layers for Different Features**:
     - **4 Areas**: Create a polygon layer with fields for **ID** and **Name**.
     - **4 Gardens**: Create another polygon layer with fields for **ID** and **Name**.
     - **2 Highways**: Create a line layer with fields for **ID** and **Name**.
     - **2 Railway Tracks**: Create a line layer with fields for **ID**, **Name**, and **Line**.
     - **5 Railway Stations**: Create a point layer with fields for **ID**, **Name**, and **Line**.
     - **5 Restaurants**: Create a point layer with fields for **ID** and **Name** (at least 2 should be inside any garden).
     - **5 Hospitals**: Create a point layer with fields for **ID** and **Name**.
     - **10 Buildings/Residential Compounds/Business**: Create a polygon or point layer with fields for **ID** and **Name**.

#### 2. **Add and Format Layers**:
   - **Gardens**: Create 4 polygons to represent gardens. Make sure each has an **ID** and **Name**.
   - **Highways**: Add 2 highway lines with suitable names and IDs.
   - **Railway Tracks**: Add 2 railway track lines with attributes like **ID**, **Name**, and **Line**.
   - **Railway Stations**: Add 5 points to represent stations, with **ID**, **Name**, and **Line** fields.
   - **Restaurants**: Add 5 points for restaurants, ensuring that at least 2 are inside the garden polygons. Use **ID** and **Name** attributes.
   - **Hospitals**: Add 5 points for hospitals with **ID** and **Name** fields.
   - **Buildings/Residential Compounds**: Add 10 polygons or points for buildings/businesses with appropriate **ID** and **Name** attributes.

#### 3. **Create Map Layout**:
   - **North Pointer**: 
     - Go to the **Print Layout** (Project > New Print Layout).
     - Click the **Add North Arrow** button and place the north pointer on the layout.
   - **Add Legend**: 
     - Click the **Add Legend** button and place it on the layout. The legend should display all the features you’ve added, such as gardens, highways, restaurants, hospitals, etc.
   - **Add Scale Bar**:
     - Use the **Add Scale Bar** button to add a scale bar to the map layout.
     - Adjust the scale bar to match the scale of your map (e.g., 1:10,000, 1:20,000).
   - **Set the Map Title**: 
     - Add a title like “Residential Area Map” at the top of the layout.

#### 4. **Symbol Customization**:
   - **Use a Symbol for Hospitals**: 
     - Select the **Hospital** layer and go to the **Layer Styling Panel**.
     - Choose an appropriate symbol to represent hospitals (e.g., a red cross or hospital icon).
   - **Use a Metro Station Symbol for One Railway Station**:
     - For one of the railway stations, go to the **Layer Styling Panel** and change the symbol to a **Metro Station** icon (you can use any metro or subway icon available or import a custom one).

#### 5. **Save the Map**:
   - Once all layers are properly added, styled, and arranged in the layout:
     - Go to **Layout** > **Export as Image**.
     - Save the map in **JPEG** format with a resolution of **1500 dpi**.
     - Adjust the export settings to ensure the resolution and quality are suitable.

#### 6. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Review your map for clarity and readability. Make sure all symbols are distinct and the labels are legible.
   - Ensure the map title, legend, scale bar, and north pointer are properly placed without overlapping features.

#### 7. **Save Your Project**:
   - Save your QGIS project in **.qgs** format for future modifications.
   - Share or print your map in **JPEG format** for presentation.
