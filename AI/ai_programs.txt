### **Practical 3: Displaying Different LED Patterns with Raspberry Pi**

**Aim**: To create and display various LED patterns using a Raspberry Pi.

**Hardware Requirements**:
- Breadboard
- LEDs (at least 4)
- Resistors (220Ω or 330Ω recommended)
- Jumper Wires
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)
- Keyboard and Mouse
- HDMI Cable and Monitor
- Power Supply

**Procedure**:
1. **Set Up the Hardware**:
   - Place 4 LEDs on the breadboard. Ensure you identify the longer terminal (anode, positive) and shorter terminal (cathode, negative) of each LED.
   - Connect each anode to separate GPIO pins (e.g., Pins 7, 29, 31, 33) on the Raspberry Pi using jumper wires.
   - Attach resistors between the cathodes of the LEDs and the ground rail on the breadboard. This prevents the LEDs from burning out.
   - Connect the ground rail to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., Pin 9).

2. **Write the Python Code**:
   - Use the `RPi.GPIO` library to control the LEDs. The code defines the pattern and duration for each LED.
   - Example code:
     ```python
     import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
     import time

     # Set up the board and GPIO pins
     GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
     GPIO.setwarnings(False)

     # Define the LED pins
     led_pins = [7, 29, 31, 33]
     for pin in led_pins:
         GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.OUT)

     try:
         while True:
             # Turn on all LEDs sequentially
             for pin in led_pins:
                 GPIO.output(pin, True)
                 time.sleep(0.5)
             # Turn off all LEDs sequentially
             for pin in led_pins:
                 GPIO.output(pin, False)
                 time.sleep(0.5)
     except KeyboardInterrupt:
         print("Program stopped")
     finally:
         GPIO.cleanup()
     ```

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Save the file as `led_pattern.py` and run it using the terminal:
     ```
     python3 led_pattern.py
     ```
   - Observe the LEDs turning on and off in a sequence.

**Explanation**:
- This code lights up LEDs one by one, waits briefly, and then turns them off in reverse order, creating a simple pattern.

**Conclusion**:
This practical demonstrates how the Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins can be used to create interactive LED patterns, showcasing basic electronics control and programming.

     camera = PiCamera()
     camera.resolution = (1280, 720)
     camera.start_preview()
     time.sleep(5)  # Wait for the camera to adjust settings
     camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/photo.jpg')
     camera.stop_preview()
     print("Image captured and saved.")
     ```

4. **Write the Code for Recording Video**:
   ```python
   from picamera import PiCamera
   import time

   camera = PiCamera()
   camera.start_preview()
   camera.start_recording('/home/pi/Desktop/video.h264')
   time.sleep(10)  # Record for 10 seconds
   camera.stop_recording()
   camera.stop_preview()
   print("Video recorded and saved.")
   ```

5. **Run the Code**:
   - Save the code and execute it through the terminal. The image will be saved to the specified path.

**Explanation**:
- The Pi Camera captures and saves images and videos, demonstrating basic multimedia capabilities of the Raspberry Pi.
