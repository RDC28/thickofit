### **QGIS Practical – Farm and Village Map**

#### **Part 1: Map Creation**

1. **Create a New QGIS Project** and save it with a name like “FarmVillageMap”.

2. **Create Vector Layers** using **Layer > Create Layer > New Shapefile Layer**:

- **Line Layers**:  
  - Highway (`id`) – Add 1 highway with id = "375"  
  - Paths (`id`) – Add 4 narrow paths  
  - Main Road – Add one road near farms that touches the highway

- **Polygon Layers**:  
  - Farms (`id`, `own_name`) – Add 6 farms (2 near the highway)  
  - Residential Areas – Add 4 areas (at least one near a farm and one near the main road)

- **Point Layers**:  
  - Farm Houses (`id`, `frm_id`) – Add 2 in any two farms  
  - Primary Schools – Add 2  
  - Bus Stop and Auto Stand – Add both near the main road  
  - Grampanchayat Office – Add 1  
  - Wells – Add 4 (3 in farms and 1 in residential area)

3. **Add Features**  
   - Use **Toggle Editing → Add Feature Tool** to draw and input all the above elements.

4. **Customize Symbols**  
   - Use different icons for schools, wells, and farm houses using **Layer Properties > Symbology**.

#### **Part 2: Perform Queries**

1. **Show Farms that Contain Wells**  
   - Use **Select by Location**:  
     - Layer → Select by Location  
     - Target layer: **Farms**  
     - Source layer: **Wells**  
     - Predicate: **"Farms that contain Wells"**

2. **Calculate Area of Each Farm**  
   - Open **Farms Attribute Table**  
   - Click **Field Calculator**:  
     - Create new field: `area`  
     - Expression: `$area`  
   - Click OK → Sort by area in descending order to find the largest farm.

3. **Show Paths that Intersect Highway**  
   - Use **Select by Location**:  
     - Target layer: **Paths**  
     - Source layer: **Highway**  
     - Predicate: **"intersects"**
