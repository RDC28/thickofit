so first you just open the google colab and press ctrl + O there to open the fucking file manager and then double click the fucking .ipynb file.
first you press connect button on the top right hand side of the colab screen.
then you find the stupid ass file manager logo in the left hand side of the google colab window and click it to open the fucking file manager of google colab and then if you open you r eyes you will see and upload button you click it and then upload the sales_data (1).csv file to google colab. this file is necessary else youre fucking dead.

all the fucking questions are written fucking right there and all you have to do is fucking read and find the fucking question and then if you look fucking carefully you will find a fucking downward arrow to fucking expand that question and give you the fucking code and all you have to do is fucking run all the codes one by one top to bottom.

and write all that code in the fukcing paper.

as for excel you just open the .xlsx file and look at the fucking bottom to find 4 sheets each sheet has the question and answer.

-- by changing: B5 (NOT $B$5)
- and press fucking OK button
