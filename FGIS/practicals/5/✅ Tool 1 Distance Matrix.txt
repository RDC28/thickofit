✅ Tool 1: Distance Matrix
This calculates distances from one point layer to another.

Example: Calculate distance from Schools to Hospitals
Go to Processing → Toolbox

Search for Distance Matrix

Double-click "Distance Matrix"

Fill out the form:

Input point layer: Schools

Target point layer: Hospitals

Output matrix type: Linear (N x 1)

Click Run

✅ You'll get a table showing distance from each school to the nearest hospital

You can export this table as CSV if needed for reports

✅ Tool 2: Points in Layer (Spatial Join)
This finds how many points (e.g., hospitals or schools) fall within another layer (like buildings or parks).

Example: How many Hospitals are inside Parks
Go to Vector → Analysis Tools → "Join attributes by location (summary)"

Fill it out:

Input layer: Parks

Join layer: Hospitals

Geometric predicate: Contains

Summaries to calculate: Count

Click Run

✅ It’ll add a new column in the Parks layer showing how many hospitals are inside each park (likely 0, but this is just an example).

✅ Final Output
At the end, you should have:

5 layers created and saved (line, polygon, point)

Distance Matrix output (CSV or table)
