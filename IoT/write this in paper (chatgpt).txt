4. Jumper wires
5. Raspberry Pi
6. Keyboard and Mouse
7. HDMI Cable
8. Power Supply

**Procedure**:
1. **Connect the LEDs**:
   - Place multiple LEDs on the breadboard. Make sure to identify the longer terminal (positive) and the shorter terminal (negative) of each LED.
   - Connect the positive terminal of each LED to the corresponding GPIO pins (e.g., Pin 7, 29, 31, 33) using jumper wires.
   - Connect the negative terminals through resistors and then connect them to the ground (e.g., Pin 9).

2. **Write the Python Code**:
   - Use the `RPi.GPIO` library in Python to control the GPIO pins.
   - Set up each GPIO pin as an output and write a program that toggles these LEDs on and off to create different patterns.

   ```python
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time

   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
   GPIO.setwarnings(False)
   GPIO.setup(7, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.setup(29, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.setup(31, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.setup(33, GPIO.OUT)

   while True:
       GPIO.output(7, True)
       GPIO.output(29, False)
       GPIO.output(31, True)
       GPIO.output(33, False)
       time.sleep(1)
       
       GPIO.output(7, False)
       GPIO.output(29, True)
       GPIO.output(31, False)
       GPIO.output(33, True)
       time.sleep(1)
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Save and run the Python script. Observe the LEDs blinking in the set pattern.

**Conclusion**:
The LEDs successfully display different patterns based on the program, demonstrating the ability of the Raspberry Pi to control external components.

     import time

     camera = PiCamera()
     camera.start_preview()
     time.sleep(5)
     camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image.jpg')
     camera.stop_preview()
     ```

4. **Record a Video**:
   - Modify the script to record a video:
     ```python
     camera.start_recording('/home/pi/Desktop/video.h264')
     time.sleep(10)
     camera.stop_recording()
     ```

5. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the script in the terminal to capture images or videos.

**Conclusion**:
The Raspberry Pi camera module successfully captures images and records videos, demonstrating its integration with the Raspberry Pi.
